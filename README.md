# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Started a Data Science course and Learning C++.

**Thoughts:** I dont know what to think, actually... 


### Day 2: April 2, 2025 

**Today's Progress**:Still doing both.

**Thoughts:** I just started to see how long this path of coding will be, in any option i choose.


### Day 3: April 3, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: I'm still learning C, but i started the Computer science introduction with python.

### Day 4: April 4, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: I did a little of my course of Data Science, but my focus was mostly on C and Python. I'm posting some of the codes in two repo: 
  -https://github.com/jqmRamos/Dumb-and-Easy-Python-Codes
  -https://github.com/jqmRamos/Dumb-and-Easy-C-Projects

  

### Day 5: April 5, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Today i've got some work to do at home, so i just studied a bit of Python and falled asleep, lol.
**Thoughts:** I feel kinda lost in coding, besides i understand the classes, but the distance between these console codes and a real app is just so big in my mind.



### Day 6: April 6, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Its sunday, I watched more of introduction to computer science and maybe tried some leet code.

**Thoughts:** I saw a post on instagram comparing programming with League of Legends ranks, that helped me to understand where i am and where the apps i'm imaginating are.
