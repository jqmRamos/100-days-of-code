# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 21, 2025 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the Whatsapp Bot JS.

**Thoughts:** Actually, i'm not getting better with JS, but i need to finish this project in this month yet. I hope i can finish the studies with css soon, so i can start java script and go to study backend with node.
